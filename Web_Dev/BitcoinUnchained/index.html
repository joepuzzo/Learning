        <h1>A helpful guide to understanding the Bitcoin Protocol</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          “What is Bitcoin?”. At first glance, the idea of a cryptocurrency seems pretty cool, but its hard for people to understand. There is much more to Bitcoin than meets the eye. At its core, the technology is pretty complex. The goal of this guide is to break bitcoin into simple analogies that anyone can understand. I aim to unchain the protocol.

        <h1>History</h1>
        <img id = "history"src="images/history.png" alt="history" />
        <p>October 31 2008, a man by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper detailing a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. A few months later, version 0.1 was released to to the public. To this day none knows who Satoshi actually is, but his innovative ideas have lead to an entirely new industry.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h1>What is bitcoin?</h1>
        <p>Bitcoin is a peer to peer “digital currency”, or more appropriately its a “cryptocurrency”. Digital currency simply means its a currency that is represented by bits in a computer <b style="color: #ff8900">00110</b>, or in the case of bitcoin, many computers. Cryptocurrency by definition is a “medium of exchange using cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of new units”. In other words, the security and trust of the currency is implemented using <b style="color: #ff8900">cryptography</b>. Finally, peer to peer means this currency is distributed from one user to another without an intermediate like a bank.

        <img id = "red_header"src="images/StartSimple.png" alt="simple"/>
        <h1>You the user!</h1>
        <p>Bitcoin is a network of computers and you are a node... Well your computer is. You run a bitcoin client on your PC that keeps track and secures your bitcoin. This client is reffered to as a <b>bitcoin wallet</b>.               </p>
        <img id = "history"src="images/Peer2Peer_Wallet.png" alt="p2p wallet"/>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h1>So I have bits that represent bitcoin in my wallet ???</h1>
        <img style="width:300px; height:auto" src="images/well_no.png" alt="well_no" />
        <img style="width:400px; height:auto" src="images/crossed_off.png" alt="crossed_off" />
        <p> 
            Your wallet simply knows all of the transactions that you were involved in.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h1>Lets me elaborate!</h1>
        <p>In order to understand this lets break Bitcoin down into a simple analogy! Suppose I have a piece of paper called the “public ledger”. </p>
        <img id = "history"src="images/unencrypted_ledger.png" alt="unencrypted_ledger" />
        <p>This “ledger” is publicly on the internet and therefore can be viewed by anyone in the world. But, unlike the traditional client server architecture that we might be familiar with, this ledger is not stored in one location( i.e on a server). Rather, the ledger is stored locally on many computers within the peer to peer network. 
        </p>
        <img id = "history"src="images/distributed_ledger.png" alt="distributed_ledger" />
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h1>Meet Alice!</h1>
        <p>Now suppose we have a girl Alice that is storing this ledger on her computer. For doing so lets say she is rewarded 1 bitcoin (I will go into mining bitcoin later). So a new line is added to the ledger that states ( 1Bitcoin —> Alice ).
