The idea is that by providing some information i.e ( fingerprint and password ) your private key will be generated dynamically. Thus you provide a service that, after the info has been provided, can spend your cryptocurrency. I prose the use of any electronic device that is cabable of taking input from a fingerprint or other method of secondary authentication that will use a known hashing algorithum to has together your password and the hash from the secondary input source. I denote source1 as A and source2 as B. When A and B are hased, the result will be a result C that is the private key of your bitcoin wallet. My goal is to do as the original currency was designed to do. Private keys should not be stored on a server or even in cold storage that is controlled by a third party such as CoinBase Xapo or Circle. I would suggest that these services instead only keep track of data using the public keys (walled addresses) and providing the user of the service with useful data. Because the private key is generated by theholder of the actual bitcoin then this method will yield to a much more secure approch.
